## About Me

Hi, I'm Anton. I have a strong passion for web development and am currently studying informatics at WSB Merito University. In my free time, I enjoy working on various web projects to expand my skills and explore new technologies.

Currently, I work as an electrician in the marine field and I am eager to transition into a role that aligns more closely with my web development interests.
